        <div id="DoomsdayDescription" class="div-card">
            <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_rule">Doomsday Rule</a>
                is an algorithm created by 
                <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/John_Horton_Conway">John Conway</a>
                for calculating the day of the week of any day in history or the future.</p>
                <p>There are a few principles which make these calculations possible. There are patterns in the cycle of days in the week over the course of months, years, decades and even centuries.</p>
                <p>For example, there are approximately 5,217.86 weeks in a century. This means that every 100 years, the same date will be a numerically different day of the week by a roughly constant amount.</p>
                <p>This means that 28/2/2100 will be a tuesday, 28/2/2200 will be a Thursday, and 28/2/2300 will be a Saturday - a difference of two days each time.</p>
                <p>These cycles allow us to calculate what day of the week any date will be - you can even do it in your head!</p>
